## 提示词指南
### How to Prompt

1. **Be Specific:** Clearly describe the main subject, setting, and any key elements you want in the video.
    - Example: "A serene beach at sunset with waves gently crashing on the shore and seagulls flying in the sky."
2. **Include Details:** Mention any particular details that are important for the video.
    - Example: "The beach has golden sand and a few palm trees. The sky is painted with hues of pink and orange."
3. **Focus on Emotions or Atmosphere:** Describe the mood or atmosphere you want to convey.
    - Example: "The video should feel peaceful and calming.”
4. **Use Simple Language:** Avoid complex terms and jargon. Simple, straightforward language is most effective.
    - Example: "A cozy living room with a crackling fireplace and a cat sleeping on the rug."

### Image to Video Tips

- Upload a JPG, JPEG or PNG image by clicking the image icon on the generation page, you can also choose to provide a prompt to describe the scene.
- With “Enhance Prompt” enabled, you just need to describe what you want to happen in the scene. For example: `<image of a car> + “*a red car driving on a road*”`
    - It’s especially helpful to describe the types of motions that you want to happen in the video
- If you cannot get the desired output, you can try without “Enhance prompt”. This requires describing the image + what you want to happen in the scene.
    - You might see no or low motion with unenhanced prompts. Try to include motion cues in your prompt if necessary.
- In either case, it helps to describe the important details in the image as much as possible, what types of actions are being performed, and how the different parts of the scene should move. E.g., `A woman dancing ballet, her arms gracefully extending upward as she twirls around, the dancers behind her bowing low to the ground`
- In general, you may get better results by being more specific about:
    - Camera motion: `*“A dramatic zoom in”, “An FPV drone shot”*`
    - Actions and motion: `*“A teddy bear swimming with its arms and feet as the turbulent water splashes all around”*`
    - Object features: `*“A white teddy bear wearing sunglasses with soft fur texture”*`
    - Setting and background: `“A beautiful cloudy sunset near a Caribbean beach”`

### Text to Video Tips

- A great way to start to get good results is to use “Enhanced Prompt”. By enabling this you can use short prompts like *“a teddy bear swimming in the ocean”* and the Dream Machine will automatically generate additional descriptions to help create a more detailed generation.
- If you are not able to get the expected results, try without “Enhance Prompt”. **Unenhanced prompts need to describe the contents of the scene and the desired action (3-4 sentences)**. Ex: `“*In a somber, nostalgic style, a young man sits on a tree stump in a forest, the warm autumn leaves surrounding him. He wears a brown jacket, dark shirt, and blue jeans, his fingers deftly moving along the fretboard of an acoustic guitar.*”`
- In general, you may get better results by being more specific about:
    - Camera motion: `*“A dramatic zoom in”, “An FPV drone shot”*`
    - Actions and motion: `*“A teddy bear swimming with its arms and feet as the turbulent water splashes all around”*`
    - Object features: `*“A white teddy bear wearing sunglasses with soft fur texture”*`
    - Setting and background: `“A beautiful cloudy sunset near a Caribbean beach”`
